This is the main place on Github for projects which are created at the 8th Code The City weekend which takes place in Aberdeen on 25th and 26th February 2017.

Each of the projects will have its own Gitub repo within the CodeTheCity organisation. And each project team will have memembers with access to the repos. 

Ian has set up a first repo [slackbot-example](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/slackbot-example) which shows how he created a chatbot to run under Slack.
